In this homework I will use webscraping to get a recommendation list of movies that include the cast of the movie Train to Busan, which is one of my favorite movies.

This webscraping work answers the following question.

> What movie or TV shows share actors with your favorite movie or show?

We will start at the movie page: <https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/396535> <br> 
And our next step is to get the page of the full cast and crew: <https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/396535/cast> <br> 
And final step is go to every actor's page to scrape all the movies and shows this actor participated: the link should be something like <https://www.themoviedb.org/person/150903-gong-yoo>
